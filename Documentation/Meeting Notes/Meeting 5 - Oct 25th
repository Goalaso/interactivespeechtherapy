2. Volume Awareness
Prompts and Strategies for Encouraging Users to Speak Louder:
*Encouraging Phrases:
  *"Great effort! Can you try raising your voice just a bit more?"

  *"Try to project your voice more; a little more volume will help!"
  *"Can you increase your volume just a notch?"
*Positive Reinforcement:
  *"That sounded good! Letâ€™s add a little more volume to it!"
  *"Awesome start! Just a bit louder will make it even better!"
*Visual Cues:
  *Accompany prompts with visual feedback, such as a volume bar that changes color as the user speaks louder. Examples:
    *"Aim for the green zone on the volume bar!"
3. Volume Feedback Mechanism
  *Add a visual volume bar to indicate the ideal volume range during exercises.
  *Volume Categories: Low, Good, Better.
  *Stress the idea of a "personal best" volume for each user.
4. Mobile-Friendly Design
