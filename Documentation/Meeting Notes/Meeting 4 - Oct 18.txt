Meeting 3
October 18, 2024
Agenda: 

•	Address some of the tools and config management we will be using for the project.
•	Overall plan, as well as talking about our initial user stories etc.
-

We won’t merge all individual github branches to the server at once, we will merge individually.
Daves recommendation for merging -- Once we get the core project initialized, where we are then working on independent features, we can start integrating concurrently. Until then we should have one person integrating our branches and handle merging, that way we aren’t stepping on each other.
Configuration management – we need to keep the VPS consistent in terms of up-to-date files. This is probably not an issue since our github repository will manage a lot of this automatically, but something to keep in mind when merging the repo to the VPS.

Building demo’s/Feedback Loop – We can follow a typical agile sprint cycle with gathering feedback from our users directly, then plan our development sprints around the feedback we have gotten on our demo features.

Initial feedback will probably be from wire diagrams to get a general feel of how users are responding from our UI design choices.
-

Design choices – Buttons should be as big as possible while also having enough space between them. Make it accessible for those with dexterity/mobility issues.
Things to keep in mind for design – During our interactions with the users, we should provide encouraging feedback to keep them motivated during therapy. The raw data summary may say they are regressing in terms of their symptoms, we shouldn’t provide that information directly to them. Or keep it configurable to the user. i.e Someone may like blunt matter of fact feedback immediately but others may want no feedback at all and leave that portion to their speech pathologist to go over with them.
