Meeting 6 Notes: 11/15/2024
Agenda:
*Update on website and PRATT analysis functionality.
*Explore Zoom for Healthcare integration.
*Address concerns about inappropriate language in outputs.
*Discuss pairing audio with transcription and Whisper behavior.
*Review plans for password authentication and testing environments.
*Evaluate options for storing and encrypting voice data.
*Discuss implementation of exercise routines.
1. Website Update
*The website has been updated!
2. PRATT Analysis Integration
*The system now sends an audio file that is analyzed for frequency, aiding speech pathologists in assessment.
3. Zoom for Healthcare
*Exploring Zoom Health Authority for secure telehealth services, ensuring compliance for virtual care and collaboration.
4. Addressing Inappropriate Language in Speech Augmentation
*Be cautious of inappropriate language in outputs when using the Samsung dataset for augmentative communication.
*Reliance on ChatGPT guardrails to censor offensive language effectively.
5. Audio Pairing and Transcription
*Pairing audio with transcription is essential to ensure clarity and accuracy.
*Issues with Whisper AI:
  *It may create words it mishears unless paired with transcription.
  *It performs auto-correction but with a low confidence rating compared to Google, which offers a higher confidence rating.
6. Password Authentication for Testing
*Current plan:
  *Avoid full password encryption/authentication for now to facilitate easier testing.
  *Create two versions:
    *One with login credentials.
    *One without, to simplify testing without handling sensitive data.
7. Storing and Encrypting Voice Data
*Voice data storage options:
    *Current approach: Store audio files externally and save their file paths in the database.
    *Use SQLite with a library to manage metadata (e.g., JSON) that is later stored in SQL.
*Encryption Considerations:
    *Exposed directories can allow unauthorized access to audio files.
    *SQL can encrypt paths for enhanced security.
8. Exercise Routines
*Implement 30 minutes of broken-down exercises spread throughout the week.
    *Incorporate various activities and tasks to provide comprehensive practice for users.
