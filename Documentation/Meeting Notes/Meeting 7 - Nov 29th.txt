Summary:

T Anton and Dave reviewed the progress of their coding project, specifically a React skeleton that has been developed. Dave discussed the facial tracking technology designed to assist individuals with Parkinson's in understanding emotional communication through facial expression monitoring. User feedback has been mixed, with some users finding it helpful while others struggle to connect it to speech. The technology aims to track facial landmarks and provide prompts without displaying facial data, enhancing communication effectiveness.

The evaluation of speech therapy effectiveness was another key topic, with Dave explaining the establishment of baseline measurements for various speech characteristics, such as vocal range and speech tempo. These metrics are intended to track patient progress and tailor exercises to individual capabilities. Challenges related to patients with unique accents were also discussed, with Dave suggesting that retraining automated speech recognition systems could improve their accuracy for diverse speech patterns. He emphasized the importance of feedback on proposed components to ensure they meet the needs of the target population.

Dave provided insights into the chatbot's functionality, which is designed to produce unique content across four carousel pages with varying difficulty levels. While user feedback has been generally positive, inconsistencies in the chatbot's output, particularly regarding punctuation and response depth, were noted as areas needing refinement. Additionally, Dave outlined challenges in ensuring timely content delivery due to multiple API calls, explaining the decision to replace Whisper with NVIDIA's Parakeet to enhance processing speed for their video chat application, which is crucial for users requiring speech rehabilitation.

The meeting also covered an innovative AI tool aimed at improving communication for individuals with speech difficulties, which will correct mispronounced words in real-time. This tool will utilize speech-to-text and text-to-speech technologies, along with voice cloning, to facilitate natural interactions. Dave highlighted a collaboration with the University of Reading for a clinical trial involving Parkinson's patients, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the app's core requirements while adapting to feedback. The discussion concluded with considerations on economic buyers, regional healthcare policies, and the evolution of touchscreen technology, underscoring the need for intuitive design and tailored marketing strategies.
